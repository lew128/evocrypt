DO NOT USE THIS CODE, yet.

Yesterday I discovered a serious discordance between results of testing
with dieharder, that thinks my crypto RNGS are first rate, and my own
checks, which say they have cycles and far too many zero and -1 bytes
and words.

I don't understand wtf? yet, and until I do understand that and its
sources, until I get the matter resolved, this code should not be used.

If my test code is not producing bogus results , and I can't see how it
could be, then either dieharder isn't checking something correctly, or I
am not using it correctly.

I don't see how those could be true, either, although I had some
suspicions based on how much non-randomness I had to intentionally add
to a prng stream before dieharder detected it.

Could take some time to understand all this. Another case of assumptions
that should have been checked much earlier.

I hope this has not caused problems for anyone.
